ADDITIONAL_LLM_INSTRUCTION=The following sections contain relevant context information retrieved through RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) from the knowledge base. Use these RAG contexts as supportive references, but primarily base your response on the XML-Diagram provided. Combine insights from both the diagram and the RAG context to create a comprehensive and accurate text description. # Additional instruction to append for the LLM
